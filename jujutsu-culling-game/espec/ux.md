# Role and Objective
You are an Expert UX/UI Designer and Frontend Developer. Your objective is to design and prototype a highly responsive, modern, and immersive Single Page Application (SPA) dashboard using Tailwind CSS. 

# Project Context
This is the "Culling Games (Jogo do Abate) - Central Control Panel" from the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. The application serves as a military-grade, tactical monitoring system used to register sorcerers and track their life status and points in real-time.

# Visual Identity & Design System
*   **Theme:** Strict Dark Mode. The interface must feel tactical, utilitarian, and slightly ominous, avoiding friendly or overly bright layouts.
*   **Typography:** Primary font should be `Inter` or `Roboto Mono` for a data-heavy, technical feel. Use uppercase with generous letter-spacing for section headers.
*   **Color Palette (Tailwind Tokens):**
    *   **Backgrounds:** Deep, dark tones. Use `bg-zinc-950` for the main canvas, `bg-zinc-900` for panels/cards, and `bg-zinc-800` for borders/dividers.
    *   **Text:** `text-zinc-300` for body text, `text-zinc-100` for headings, `text-zinc-500` for muted/helper text.
    *   **Accents (Cursed Energy):** 
        *   Primary Action/Danger: Crimson Red (`text-red-500`, `bg-red-600`).
        *   Domain/Mystic Elements: Deep Purple (`text-purple-400`, `bg-purple-600`).
        *   Success/Active Status: Spectral Green (`text-emerald-400`, `bg-emerald-500/20`).

# Layout & Structure (Desktop First, Mobile Responsive)
The layout uses a split-screen dashboard approach.
*   **Left Panel (Fixed Sidebar - 30% width on Desktop): The Registration Zone.**
    *   A cohesive form panel to register new players.
    *   Fields: "Sorcerer Name" (Text Input), "Starting Colony" (Dropdown/Select), and "Cursed Technique" (Text Area).
    *   Action: A full-width, prominent submit button stylized with a red or purple accent (e.g., "ENTER THE CULLING GAME").
*   **Right Panel (Main Content - 70% width on Desktop): The Monitoring Grid.**
    *   A top header showing total active players and total points distributed.
    *   A CSS Grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`) displaying "Player Cards".

# Component Specifications

## 1. Player Card (Micro-Component)
Each card must display the player's data with clear information hierarchy:
*   **Header:** Player Name (bold, white) and a status badge (e.g., a glowing green dot for "Alive", a red cross for "Deceased").
*   **Body:** 
    *   Colony Name (small, uppercase, zinc-400).
    *   Current Points: Large, highly visible typography (e.g., `text-4xl text-purple-400 font-mono`).
*   **Footer (Actions):** Two distinct, small icon buttons to Add (+1) or Subtract (-1) points, representing the rules of point transfer in the games. Use subtle hover states (`hover:bg-zinc-700`).

## 2. Form Inputs (Micro-Component)
*   Inputs must have a dark background (`bg-zinc-950`), subtle borders (`border-zinc-700`), and focus states that glow with an accent color (`focus:ring-purple-500`). Remove default browser outlines.

# Output Requirements
Generate the complete HTML structure utilizing exclusively Tailwind CSS utility classes. Ensure the layout is responsive (stacking the form above the grid on mobile screens). The code must be clean, semantic, and ready to be componentized into an Angular 21 environment.
